[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/chiasm-project/chiasm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chiasm-project/chiasm) Latest version: [chiasm-v0.2.1.js](http://chiasm-project.github.io/chiasm/chiasm-v0.2.1.js)

Chiasm is a browser based runtime environment and component architecture for
interactive data visualizations. It allows plugins for data access, data
transformation, and interactive visualization to be loaded and configured
dynamically.

Here's a video that explains the history of the project: [Story of the Chiasm Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qos1QSIfZhE), and here's another that covers the details of how Chiasm works and how you can use it: [Introduction to Chiasm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpweS7gNBt4).

## Usage

You can include Chiasm in your page like this:

```html
<script src="http://chiasm-project.github.io/chiasm/chiasm-v0.2.0.js"></script>
```

This will introduce a global variable `Chiasm`, which is a constructor function for instances of the Chiasm runtime environment.

Chiasm can also be used as an [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chiasm). To install, run

```
npm install -S chiasm
```

To use in your CommonJS JavaScript, you can require it like this:

```
var Chiasm = require("chiasm");
```

## Components

The subproject [chiasm-component](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm-component) defines a common base for Chiasm components.

Several components are also subprojects under [github.com/chiasm-project](https://github.com/chiasm-project/):

 * [chiasm-layout](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm-layout) Nested box layout for Chiasm components.

   * [bubble-map.js](https://gist.github.com/curran/81271937fa94fdbdd854#file-bubble-map-js) from [Migrant Deaths Map](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/81271937fa94fdbdd854) An extension of chiasm-leaflet.js that visualizes data using circles on a map.

There is a [collection of components in the v0.1.9 archive branch](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm/tree/archive_v0.1.9/src/plugins). These will eventually be ported to the v0.2.0 API, and moved into their own separate repositories.

# Background

The core concept of this project is that interactive graphics, particularly data visualizations, can be instantiated, configured with
data, arranged on the screen, and coupled together to produce interactive linked
views.

A JSON configuration structure defines the entire state of a Chiasm
application. The configuration refers to plugins by name, which are invoked to instantiate instances of 
components. Configuration changes can be made at runtime, and Chiasm will
propagate the changes through the system. The JSON configuration also updates in
response to changes in the state of the component's [Model](https://github.com/curran/model) at runtime.

With visualizations, this means that the state users arrived at by interacting with the system (customizing visualization parameters, changing the columns visualized, or changing colors) can be serialized. This makes it possible to build a system that stores and retrieves editable Chiasm configurations.

## Configuration Structure and Runtime Environment

A configuration is a JSON object encapsulating an application state. This
configuration contains specifications for a set of runtime components, each of
which has:

 * a unique name (called the "alias" of the component),
 * an associated plugin that creates the runtime component, and
 * a key-value dictionary specifying the state of the runtime component.

This organization allows a dynamic configuration structure to drive the state of
the application, and also allows changes resulting from user interactions with
runtime components to be propagated back to the configuration.

![Runtime Diagram](http://curran.github.io/images/visEditor/Runtime.png)

This diagram illustrates that

 * Plugins create runtime components.
 * Changes in configuration propagate to runtime components.
 * Changes in runtime components propagate back to the configuration.

# The word "[Chiasm](http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=chiasm02&word=chiasm&text=)"

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/1543%2CVisalius%27OpticChiasma.jpg" width=200>

> The optic nerve fibres on the nasal sides of each retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic **chiasm**. -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasm)

> The **Chiasm** was a junction of interdimensional networks and corridors that allowed for instantaneous travel over long distances of space. - [Dr. Who](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Chiasm)

**Chiasm**, this project, relates to the above meanings of the word "Chiasm" in
that it connects the "brain" of data to the "eyes" of users through interactive
visualization. When Chiasm is set up to use an interactive data transformation
like [Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/), the visualization
system is an intersection of multidimensional "corridors" in data space, and
interacting with it allows users to rapidly pivot and navigate through the data.
